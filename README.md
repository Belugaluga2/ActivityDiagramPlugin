# ActivityDiagramPlugin

This is a plugin to turn data from an excel file into a cameo activity diagram. The Excel file the data comes from must have a "Name" column with the names of the actions/subactions. Main actions must either start with a whole number e.g. 1, 2, 3, ect, or start with the word "Action". Subactions must start with a decimal e.g. 1.1, 1.2. for a subaction of activity 1. That's how the excel parser function tells what is an action/subaction. In order to add input/output pins, the Excel file must have an Input column and an Output column. These columns are delimited by "," and ";", so each individual input/output will be separated by a comma/semicolon. Another column you can add is "Actor" to determine the "actor" who performs that action. The input/output/actor columns are not required meaning the plugin can still insert a diagram without them, but the name column is required. Additionally there are features to select whether you want the actions to be "Structured Activity Nodes" or "Call Behavior Actions". Actions with subdiagrams must be a "Structured Activity Node". Lastly you can also select where you want to insert the diagram in the model.
