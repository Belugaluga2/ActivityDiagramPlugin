# ActivityDiagramPlugin

This is a plugin to turn data from an excel file into a cameo activity diagram. Currently the excel file must be structured in with a name, input, and output column. Actions must be in the name column and have the word "Action" as the first word in them. That's how the excel parser function tells what is an action or not. Additionally there are features to select whether you want the actions to be "Structured Activity Nodes" or "Call Behavior Actions". Lastly you can also select where you want to insert the diagram.
